## Real Estate Price Prediction Project Summary

### Objective
To predict real estate prices, aiding in purchasing decisions and estimating the future value of owned properties. Predictions are based on factors such as surroundings, marketplaces, and other relevant attributes.

### Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration**:
    - Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies.
    - Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and identify significant features.

2. **Feature Selection**:
    - Selected key features like location, property size, age, nearby amenities, and economic factors affecting prices.

3. **Model Implementation**:
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)**: Predicted prices based on the average prices of neighboring properties.
    - **Multi-Linear Regression (MLR)**: Modeled the relationship between property price and multiple features.
    - **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: Captured non-linear relationships with a multi-layer neural network.

4. **Ensemble Methods**:
    - Combined outputs of KNN, MLR, and ANN to enhance prediction accuracy.

### Results
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) scores.
- The ensemble model provided the most accurate predictions, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multiple algorithms.

### Conclusion
Employing various machine learning techniques, including regression and neural networks, allows for robust prediction of real estate prices. The ensemble approach particularly improves reliability by leveraging the strengths of different models.
